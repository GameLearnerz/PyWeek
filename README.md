#PyWeek
This is a Project given to me by the "TSIG" to let me Learn What Matters in the Basics Of Python.
I was able to Understand the Structure of Python, Uses of NumPy, Pandas, How to WebScrape, Having fun with Computer Vision (OpenCV), Making a Todo list with FastAPI and MORE..
I thank every member of the TSIG MJCET Community to guide me throughout the week and later.

Thank You So Much For The Guidance.
